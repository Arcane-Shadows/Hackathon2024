# problem 2
You run an e-commerce site. Your users constantly ask you the same questions on Facebook and WhatsApp, even though the answers are stated clearly on the product page and the FAQ section. To handle this, you want to develop a chatbot. Assuming you have an API key for a generative model, how will you implement the chatbot so that it can answer your user's questions accurately?

# solution

 We have to use Natural Language Processing(NLP) model which can be fine Tuned on our FAQ quenstions and answers or other product page related questions.

    user prompt -> fine tuned model's api -> generated output.
